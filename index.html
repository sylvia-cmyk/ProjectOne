            <a>About Me: </a> My name is Sylvia Tan. I am Chinese Asian-American, born and raised in the states, living in San Leandro. I am currently a second-year college student attending San Francisco State University majoring in Visual Communication Design. I have a creative passion for design and the field of editing. I’ve been video editing since middle school, on my phone with apps called PicArts and Cute Cut. Since beginning video editing, my craving to improve and expand has heightened. I regularly browse video edits looking to be inspired and adapt them to my own set of skills. Whether it be from a YouTube video, a short form TikTok clip, or simply a fan edit – I find and feel my love for design everywhere. My goal before I finish college is to learn how to use Adobe After Effects. As a kid, I always wanted to use AE as I’m only limited to so much on a free phone app editor. Other than video editing, I also yearn to be multi-talented in multiple forms of art. For instance, I also love looking into and dissecting mural art, graffiti tags, game design, fashion, music, etc. – the list continues. My adoration for anything creatively driven peaks from anything and everything. I love hearing and seeing the creative process as well. Outside of the realms of art – during my free time, I enjoy playing video games, reading comics, drawing, and watching YouTube.
