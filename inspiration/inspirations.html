      <a href="https://nooneeverreallydies.com" id="etcthree"><h3>Pharrel Williams/N*E*R*D/The Neptunes</h3></a>

      <p>
         I'm extremely drawn to their visual aesthetic from the early 2000's and the sound of music they produced. The music they were producing was very different and kind of paved the way in allowing more eccentric and funky curated beats/sounds into hip hop as well as leaving an impact in street fashion. Pharrell's passion, drive, creativity, and 2000's fashion is admiring. The things he's been able to accomplish inspires me and makes me want to push myself in my own creative abilities since I also strive to be as multi-talented as him.

      <img src="img/fikemb.jpg.PNG" alt="A design focused mood board with pictures related to Dominic Fike's Sunburn album designs which includes his album cover, track list, merch, and tour poster">
      <p>
         I love the summer aesthetic of this album from the album cover, upbeat songs, combination of colors, to even the release date (july). Even the designs curated to promote this album and its tour, -- so cool and well crafted.  When it comes to video or photo editing and making cool, creative designs, -- I draw inspiration from Dominic Fike's scrapbook-like designs on this album. I don't know what it is about this album, but whenever I listen to it, it makes me want to create or just be productive in general, -- it motivates me.

      <a id="etcthree" href="https://oni-press.myshopify.com/collections/bryan-lee-omalley"><h3>Bryan Lee O'Malley</h3></a>

      <p>
         Bryan Lee O'Malley made a few other comic books, but Scott Pilgrim is the one I resonate and take creative inspiration from. Specifically, Bryan Lee O'Malley's art style in Scott Pilgrim's books 1-3. I adore the rough-like, sharp, and dull art style. I think the grunge-y ness adds to the series' charm and perfectly match the characters and just the general plot of the book. Scott Pilgrim inspires my own personal art style and creation. A lot of my drawings follow a rough, dull, and grunge-y aesthetic, of which I take from Bryan Lee O'Malley's art designs. Not only does it inspire my own personal art, but also re-ignited my passion for comics. I've always loved comics, but after reading Scott Pilgrim, it re-sparked my adoration for slice of life comics.
