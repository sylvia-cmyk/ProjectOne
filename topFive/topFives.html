             </a>
             <p> I've been in tune with Dominic Fike's music since early 2019, but it wasn't until 2021 where I became a big fan of his music.
                Hearing a few songs off of "What Could Possibly Go Wrong" was the turning point for me to take a deep dive into his discography.
                From then on, I fell in love with his music. My favorite album of his is called "Sunburn" and my favorite song is "Sick".

             <p>
                I discovered Pierce The Veil through my older brother a long time ago. He's 7 years older than me, so when he was in high school being
                emo and listening to them, 8 year old me was also indirectly listening to them. For a while, I only really knew their mainstream songs.
                I would say sometime around my junior year of high school is when I started going through their discography. My favorite album of theirs
                is "Collide With The Sky", but my favorite song is from their "Selfish Machines" album called "I don't care if you're contagious".

             <p>
                Around 2020-2021, I got really into the underground rap scence. I discovered DC The Don through one of my favorite youtubers who's friends
                with DC and was checking out his latest drop on stream. I watched this reaction video and was really into his sound. Out of all the underground
                rappers I was discovering around that time, DC really stood out to me. From then on, I've been tuned into his music. My favorite album
                from him is "My Own Worst Enemy", but my favorite song is from his "REBIRTH" album called "FLY 2 YOU".

            <p>
                N*E*R*D is one of my most recent finds that I became a fan of. I went and saw the Pharrell biopic movie, "Piece by Piece" in theathres 
                and for one, I loved loved loveddd it. It was so cool hearing songs he had produced for that I had no idea he had part of. 
                In that movie, he also talked about his music group, N*E*R*D. I recognized one of the songs that had played, but everything else was 
                completely new to me despite these songs all popping throughout the early 2000's. I loved their sound and was super intridgued. Unfortunately 
                they're disbanded, but you bet if they come back for one last reunion tour -- I'M THERE. My favorite album of theirs is "Seeing Sounds", but 
                my favorite song is from their album "In Search Of..." called "Bobby James".

                I discovered Pierre Bourne around the same time as DC The Don. Pierre Bourne isn't necessarily underground, but he doesn't get 
                much recognition for his music. His sound of music could fall into the underground category though. My favorite album of his is 
                "The Life of Pi'erre 4", with zero misses, and my favorite song is either "Guillotine" or "Doublemint".

                Minecraft is one of those videos games that stuck out with me throughout childhood. I found out about this game from my older brother.
                I would play minecraft as a kid on my iPad and watched minecraft series on youtube. I'll admit that I still love minecraft and it's one of 
                my favorite games to play with my friends.

                This game is really old and I've known about this game since my childhood through my older brother and videos of it popping 
                up on the front page on my youtube. Although, I didn't start loving this game until last year 
                when I actually started playing it myself. The genre of this game is rogue-like so naturally, it's not that fun to watch other people 
                play. My older brother got a controller as well, so it makes playing this game feel super casual. It's really addicting and enjoyable to play.

                Life is Strange is a decision based story game. This is one of the first story driven video games I discovered and watched at the 
                early age of 9. Life is Strange has always been a comfort game for me as it has super warm undertones due to it's visual aesthetics, soundtrack, 
                slice of life genre, and personable characters. This game has multiple games under the franchise and I'd say Life is Strange 2 is my favorite 
                out of the 3, and it's the only one to have made me cry. Life is Strange feels super nostalgic and just makes me feel like a kid again.

                I discovered this game in 2019 when a gaming youtuber I was subscribed to dropped an episode playing it. The premise of this game and it's 
                story was right up my alley and I love the characters so so much. The animation cut scences embedded within the gameplay are absolutely beautiful.
                The genre of this game is story based, adventure, and also fighting. Persona 5's game is over 100 hours long and takes a lot of grinding to level up and stuff 
                to continue the storyline. I don't think I could ever play this game myself or watch another full playthrough again, but despite how long ago 
                I watched this game, it forever holds a special place in my heart.

                I discovered this game in 2020 when I was looking for new vidoe game series to watch. The game is story and decision based. I definitely 
                cried a lot to this game. I love this game because of the characters and how well the developers do with making you actually care for and relate to 
                them. Mind you, it's the zombie apocalypse, so imagine how emotionally evoking this game is. This series has 4 seasons and my personal order if I had 
                to rank them would be #1 Season 2 , then Season 1, Season 3, Season 4.
